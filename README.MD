Rewind Youtube video Vim style.
This is my first chrome extension!!! This very simple and straight forward extension just binds "h" key to backward a Youtube video 10 secs.
The idea came up out of necessity since, as a Vim and Vimium user, I'd like to use "h" and "l" to go back/forward in Youtube's video timeline.
Since natively Youtube uses "l" to go forward on timeline, the extension just adds the "h" functionality.
